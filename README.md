# BibCreator
BibCreator Written In Java With Lots Of Configs And User Configurations That Can Be Done To The Application Without Need To Change The The Base Codes 


In this Application, BibCreator reads and processes a given .bib file (which has one or more articles) and create 3 different files with the correct reference formats for IEEE, ACM and NJ.
Given 10 files, called Latex1.bib to Latex10.bib. BibCreator application reads all 10 input files (in one execution), determines whether each of these files is valid or not (details given below). If a file is valid, then BibCreator will create 3 different files based on the articles in this file, one for IEEE format, one for ACM format and the last for NJ format. To distinguish our application from other existing similar software, these files are called IEEEi.json, ACMi.json, and NJi.json
